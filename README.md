# Password-Generator

This script is super easy to use, even for non-programmers. I

t’s your own personal password generator. If you don’t trust online password generators, you can run this locally in your terminal and it’ll ask you how many characters you want your password to be. 

There’s no limit - you could even have a **500-character password!**

Just paste this into a text editor **(I like Sublime Text),**

save it in your documents folder, and then open your terminal and type 

**“python3 passwordgen.py”**.

It’ll then ask you how many characters you want your password to be. Have fun!
